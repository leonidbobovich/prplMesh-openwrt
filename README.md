# OpenWrt packages for prplMesh

This feed contains packages for enabling WFA Multi-AP on a router.

This work was sponsored by [prpl Foundation](https://prplfoundation.org/).

## tch-rebase

This branch is a WIP for rebasing on the code contributed by Technicolor. Therefore, the information in the following sections is not correct for the time being.

This is how things can be tested for the time being.

* The versions in the Makefiles are not correct. Instead, you have to manually clone the 4 repositories and create a git-src symlink to each. E.g.:
```
cd ieee1905; ln -s ../../ieee1905 git-src
```

* Check out the `prpl` branch in each repo.

* Enable the agent in menuconfig. The rest should be automatically selected.

* Build `multiap_agent` and copy it to the target.

* Create `/etc/config/multiap`
```
config agent 'agent'
        option macaddress '03:04:05:06:0a:0b'
        option default_hysteresis_margin '400'
```

* Pre-allocate wireless interface. For the time being, multiap wireless interfaces have to be configured up-front in UCI. Details TBD.

* A lot of environment variables need to be set. You can call it as follows:
```
AL_ENTITY_TOPOLOGY_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL=60 MAP_MODEL_NUMBER=0 MAP_MANUFACTURER_NAME=x MAP_SERIAL_NUMBER=1 MAP_MODEL_NAME=foo MAP_INTERFACES=lo,lan0,lan1 MAP_AGENT_MACADDRESS=03:04:05:06:0a:0b multiap_agent -l 7 -s -m ubus
```


## What is WFA Multi-AP?

WFA Multi-AP networks utilize multiple APs that work together to ensure all areas of the home have complete Wi-Fi coverage and adapt to changing network conditions. See the links below for details.

## How to add the prplMesh Feed to you OpenWrt/LEDE build

prplMesh requires a modified hostapd which is not yet in upstream OpenWRT. Therefore, you need to use multiap-upstream branch from https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/staging/dangole.git

At the root of your OpenWrt/LEDE tree, add the following to your `feeds.conf` file:
```sh
src-git prplmesh https://github.com/prplfoundation/prplMesh-openwrt.git
```
Now to add the packages on your prplmesh feed to your OpenWrt/LEDE instance:
```sh
./scripts/feeds update prplmesh #retrieve the prplmesh feed from service/update to latest
./scripts/feeds install -p prplmesh #make all of the prplmesh feed packages available to the build
```

For more control over the package versions being installed, you can fork the feed using Github (and replace the `src-git` url) or maintaining a copy of the feed on your local system by using this line instead:
```sh
src-link prplmesh /full/path/to/feed/root
```
## Configuring the system

prplMesh must be configured with at least an AL MAC address. Configuration is done in the `prplmesh` config of UCI. This contains one section of type `prplmesh` that contains the
configuration of prplMesh itself, and additional sections of type `registrar` that contain the AP Autoconfiguration information for the controller.  The `prplMesh` section must contain an option `al_address` with the AL MAC address. 

To set up an unconfigured device that can be onboarded with push-button configuration, create an interface in UCI with the following configuration:
```json
{
	"encryption": "wps",
	"device": "radio0",
	"mode": "sta",
	"network": "lan",
	"wps_pushbutton": "1",
	"multi_ap": "1"
}

```

At the moment, prplMesh does not yet detect the new interface, so it needs to be restarted by hand, with `/etc/init.d/prplmesh restart`.

Push-button configuration can be started with:

```sh
ACTION=pressed BUTTON=wps /etc/rc.button/wps
```

prplMesh will then start to perform AP-Autoconfiguration over the new interface. It will get the AP information from the controller and configure the APs.

To configure a controller, add sections of type `registrar` to the UCI configurationo of prplMesh. This section must at least contain the option `ssid` with the SSID to configure.
It can also contain the option `key` with the encryption key, which sets WPA2-PSK on that SSID. Setting the option `backhaul` to 1 enables Multi-AP backhaul functionality on this AP. If also `backhaul_only` is set to 1, it is a backhaul-only AP, otherwise it is both backhaul and fronthaul. Finally, the bands can be selected with the `band` option: 1 for 2.4GHz, 2 for 5GHz, and 3 for both.
